# Classification into categories by bedrooms
I've built a classification model to classify data into one of the set categories, which is the number of bedrooms. Given other features like price, bathrooms, acre lot size, house size, city, and state.
Essentially, the model can predict what number of bedrooms will you be able to get given these criteria aka features.
